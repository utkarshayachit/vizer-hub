# vizer-hub

`vizer-hub` is a NodeJS/express web server that is intended to be used as an
example landing page for deploying [`vizer`](https://github.com/utkarshayachit/vizer)
on Azure with Azure Batch. The codebase shows how to use Azure SDK to trigger jobs/tasks
in on a Azure deployment with an Azure Batch account. One can create such a deployment
using the [`azbatch-starter`](https://github.com/utkarshayachit/azbatch-starter) accelerator.
